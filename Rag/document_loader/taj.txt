TAJ MAHAL

By the Yamuna’s gentle, silver flow, A marble dream was shaped by love
and woe. Born from grief, yet radiant and bright, A frozen tear carved
into endless white.

Each stone whispers Shah Jahan’s vow, A promise time could not disavow.
Petals bloom in carved design, Where art and sorrow intertwine.

At dawn it blushes, soft and pale, At dusk it glows through evening’s
veil. Moonlight crowns its silent dome, A lover’s heart turned into
stone.

Not built for power, pride, or war, But for a love that asked for more:
That even death should not erase The memory of one dear face.

O Taj, you stand through age and scar, Proof that love outlives the
star. When words fall short and lives depart, You still speak straight
to the human heart.
